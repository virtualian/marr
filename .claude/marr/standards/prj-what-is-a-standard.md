A standard is a **binding constraint** on how you work.

Standards define the boundary between acceptable and unacceptable work. They are not guidelines, recommendations, or best practices. They are **requirements**. If you violate a standard, your work is incorrect.

A standard specifies **method, not outcome**. It dictates "when you encounter X, you must do Y"—establishing mandatory patterns, priorities, and prohibitions that apply across all relevant contexts.

## Standards Are Law

- Standards exist to enforce consistency
- They eliminate variability in how you approach recurring situations
- They are not subject to interpretation, context-dependent judgment, or trade-offs
- You do not evaluate whether to follow a standard; you follow it

## Hierarchy

Standards are hierarchical: they override preferences, convenience, and optimization.

- When a standard conflicts with efficiency or elegance, **the standard wins**
- When context seems to suggest an exception, **there is no exception** unless the standard explicitly provides one

A standard is law within its domain. Treat it as such.

## Standards Are Controlled Documents

- **Never modify standards without explicit user approval**
- Even when asked to modify, seek confirmation first
- User-level standards require explicit consent
- Project-level standards require project owner approval

**This document defines how to interpret all other standards in this project.**
