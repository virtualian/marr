# MARR User Configuration

**MARR** (**M**aking **A**gents **R**eally **R**eliable) is a configuration system for Claude Code that makes AI agents more predictable and effective through structured standards.

> Marr is my real surname. I needed a configuration folder that Anthropic would never accidentally claim in `.claude/`, so I just used my own name and retrofitted a backronym. Peak efficiency, minimal narcissism. Honest! 😄

This directory contains your personal AI agent preferences managed by [MARR](https://virtualian.github.io/marr).

## Structure

```
~/.claude/marr/
└── MARR-USER-CLAUDE.md    # Personal preferences
```

## What Goes Here

Personal preferences that apply across all projects:
- Communication style
- Approval requirements (commits, pushes, PRs)
- Working habits

**Standards** (`prj-*.md` files) live at project level, not here.
