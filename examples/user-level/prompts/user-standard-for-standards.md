# What is a Standard

A standard is a binding constraint on how you work.

Standards define the boundary between acceptable and unacceptable work. They are not guidelines, recommendations, or best practices. They are requirements. If you violate a standard, your work is incorrect.

A standard specifies method, not outcome. It dictates "when you encounter X, you must do Y"—establishing mandatory patterns, priorities, and prohibitions that apply across all relevant contexts.

Standards exist to enforce consistency. They eliminate variability in how you approach recurring situations. They are not subject to interpretation, context-dependent judgment, or trade-offs. You do not evaluate whether to follow a standard; you follow it.

Write standards as unconditional imperatives using "must" or "must not." Every statement must be concrete and enforceable. A standard that cannot be verified as followed or violated is not a standard.

Standards are hierarchical: they override preferences, convenience, and optimization. When a standard conflicts with efficiency or elegance, the standard wins. When context seems to suggest an exception, there is no exception unless the standard explicitly provides one.

A standard is law within its domain. Treat it as such.
