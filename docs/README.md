# **M**aking **A**gents **R**eally **R**eliable [MARR]

**MARR** is a configuration system for Claude Code that makes AI agents more predictable and effective through structured standards.

> Marr is my real surname. I needed a configuration folder that Anthropic would never accidentally claim in `.claude/`, so I just used my own name and retrofitted a backronym. Peak efficiency, minimal narcissism. Honest! 😄
